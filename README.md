# RISC-V_Processor
Hello everyone,
I am Chetanya Katara, a Pre-final year student at Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology.
Here I am presenting you my project which is a 32-bit 5-staged pipelined processor based on RISC-V instruction set architecture.

The processor has 5 stages 

1. Instruction Fetch
2. Instruction Decode
3. Execute Stage
4. Memory Stage
5. Writeback Stage

Also in order to avoid pipelining hazards I have used the principle of Forwarding/Bypassing to implement a Data Hazard module
which removes data hazard (Read after Write) from the pipeline.

These instructions have been implemented.

1. LW
2. SW
3. ADD
4. SUB
5. ADDI
6. AND
7. ANDI
8. OR
9. ORI
10. XOR
11. XORI
12. BEQZ

Hope you like it.

For doubts or any advice connect with me on LinkdIn.
